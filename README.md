# Introduction

This manual describes the _hidden_ part of LODEX: its configuration file. That means, all the settings that cannot be done via its backoffice.

These settings are put in a single JSON file, called `config.json`. Given that LODEX can be used within [ezmaster](https://github.com/Inist-CNRS/ezmaster), it maybe that you access to that file through the setting button of a lodex instance \(and a JSON editor\).
